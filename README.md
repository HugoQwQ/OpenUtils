# OpenUtils

OpenUtils is a **Minecraft utility mod** created to provide a **stable collection of common gameplay utilities** in a community where utility mods are frequently deleted, abandoned, or locked behind closed distribution.

> [!WARNING]  
> OpenUtils is provided as-is and used at your own risk. Some modules may be controversial; all are optional and restricted to behavior technically possible in vanilla Minecraft.

## Why OpenUtils Exists

In the legacy Minecraft community (especially Hypixel players):

- Useful projects disappear without warning
- Code gets private, deleted, or intentionally broken
- Downstream projects are forced to rewrite the same utilities repeatedly

OpenUtils is designed to be:

- **Open-source**
- **Copyleft-protected**
- **Forkable**

## Features

- General-purpose utility modules
- Hypixel-specific utility modules
- Other QOL features to improve your legacy Minecraft experience
- Click GUI design ported from **raven b3**
